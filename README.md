# Drying-process-code
Model and simulation of drying process.
Here we present different methods for modeling and simulating the drying process of a wet towel inside a plastic container. The file 'Demonstrator' provides a sketch of the process. We compare and show different states of the experiment that provide the best evaporation rate of the towel.
